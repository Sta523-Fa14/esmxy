Final Project: Prediction of Sea Ice in North Pole
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 1. Introduction

Global warming may lead to redistribution of precipitation, disappearance of glacier and permafrost, and the raise of sea level. This may not only upset the balance of nature, but also endanger humans. Overusing different fossil fuels, excessive felling trees, as well as other human factors would probably cause increase of greenhouse gas in atmosphere. Some scientists do believe that global warming is dangerous and we should take action to reduce it. Others think it is only natural phenomena of a certain period, and no accurate evidence show that the only reason of global warming is human factor, and its long-time effect is negative.

Glacier is the largest reservoir of fresh water, about 70 percent of fresh water on the earth is stored in glacier. However, recent data suggests that the speed of global glacier melting keeps increase in more and more regions and reach the highest speed since records began. The melting of glacier may have already caused serious influence in difference aspects: with the decrease of glacier, most area, using glacier as water supply, would suffer from shortage of water. Flood hazard caused by the large amounts of melting ice, would results in casualties, and loss of property. Microorganism, buried by the ice cap, would be exposed, and the spread of such microorganism will have potential negative influence to human health.

From the existing data and analysis, we want to know about the long-time influence of the global warming to the change of icecap area. Our project aims at exploring change of ice area and temperature of North Pole, using linear regression models to detect the potential relationship between the ice area and temperature as time goes. Give a prediction of the ice area after few years, and fully illustrate the trends of glacier development in the North Pole.

## 3.1 Arctic Sea Ice Extent Trends: 1979-2013

Based on the monthly arctic sea ice extent data offered by National Snow and Ice Data Center(NSIDC), we plot

the maximum and minimum arctic sea ice extent for each year, with the trend lines added.  

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#download the area data
link_n <- "http://processtrends.com/files/RClimate_NSIDC_sea_ice_extent.csv"
sie <- read.table(link_n, skip = 1, sep = ",", header = F,
                  colClasses = rep("numeric", 5),
                  comment.char = "#", na.strings = c("NA",-9999),
                  col.names = c("yr_frac", "yr", "mo", "ext", "area"))
sie <- sie[,c(1,2,3,4)]
sie <- subset(sie, sie$yr >1978 & sie$yr < 2014)
```


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(nlme)
ann_max <- tapply(sie$ext, sie$yr, max, na.rm=T)
ann_min <- tapply(sie$ext, sie$yr, min, na.rm=T)
ann_df <- data.frame(seq(1979,2013,1), ann_max, ann_min)
names(ann_df)<- c("yr", "Max", "Min")

## Calc simple trend line for each series
glm_max <- gls(Max ~ yr, ann_df)
glm_min <- gls(Min ~ yr, ann_df)


#par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(ann_df$yr, ann_df$Max, type="o", pch=16, col="blue", xlab="Year", ylab="Annual Maximum SIE",axes=T)
text(1979,14.8, "Maximum Monthly SIE", adj=0,font=2)
abline(glm_max, col="brown")


plot(ann_df$yr, ann_df$Min, type="o", pch=16, col="green",xlab="Year", ylab="Annual Minimum SIE", axes=T)
text(1979,4.7, "Minimum Monthly SIE",adj=0,font=2)
abline(glm_min, col="brown")
```

From the two plots, we can find out that during the 1979 – 2006 period the maximums and minimums SIE  declined.  The 2007 – 2008 period showed an

increasing trend which resumed its downward slope in 2009 and 2010.

Arctic sea ice extent continued its long-term decline in the 2010 melt season. The annual maximum and minimum

sea ice extent values have declined significantly over the past 35 years with some year to year variation. 

## 3.2 Map Sea Ice

Using the sea ice shapefile data from r package `rnoaa`, we draw the plot of the sea ice shape in August from

1979 to 2013 

```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#shapefile
library(rnoaa)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(doMC)
library(plyr)
urls <- seaiceeurls(mo='Aug', pole='N')
urls<-urls[1:35]
registerDoMC(cores=4)
out <- llply(urls, seaice, .parallel=TRUE)
#out1<-out[seq(1,35,by=2)]
#names(out1) <- seq(1979,2013,by=2)
names(out) <- seq(1979,2013,1)
df <- ldply(out)
ggplot(df, aes(long, lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill="steelblue") +
  theme_ice() +
  facet_wrap(~ .id)
```

From the plot, we can find the same trend that sea ice area in Arctic has declined significantly over the past 

35 years with some year to year variation. 


# 4. Preliminary Research

Before studying the shapefile data, we begin by analyzing the area data.

We attempt to do regression analysis for sea ice area in each month. Take the sea ice area in August(which the 

temperature is the highest) as an example. 

- First, we construct a new data set for sea ice in August from the original data sets using functions in 

package `dplyr`. The new data set contains variables area, year, temperature, and humidity.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#Construct data sets for january and august sea ice
#setwd("~/R/Team7/final project")
load(file="finalData.rda")
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
newdata<-finalData %>% 
group_by(RecordDate) %>%
summarize(n = n(),temperature=mean(Temperature), humidity=mean(RelativeHumidity))



aug<-newdata[seq(8,nrow(newdata),by=12),]
aug$area<-sie[seq(8,nrow(newdata),by=12),4]
aug$RecordDate<-str_sub(aug$RecordDate,1,4)
aug$RecordDate<-as.numeric(aug$RecordDate)

```


- We select three predictors for regression: year, temperature, and humidity.

- Then we test the collinearity among three predictors. In terms of the VIF valus shown below, the there is no 

obvious collinearity(because the values of VIF are smaller than 3).

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(usdm)
library(MASS)
#test Collinearity 
vif(data.frame(aug$temperature, aug$RecordDate,aug$humidity))
```

- Use linear regression. The result of linear regression showns that the predictor humidity is not significant.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}


fit <- lm(area ~ RecordDate + temperature + humidity, data=aug)
summary(fit) # show results
#fit <- lm(area ~ temperature, data=aug)
#fit <- lm(area ~  temperature + RecordDate, data=aug)
#humidity not significant
```

- Use stepwise regression to verify the result, and the result shows that it excludes the predictor humidity, which is in accordance 

with the linear regression we did before.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
step <- stepAIC(fit, direction="both")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
step$anova # display results
```


The results for other month are similar.
